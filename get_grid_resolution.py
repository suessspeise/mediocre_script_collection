# calculates grid "resolution" from ICON grid files
# resolution is a difficult term, as it is not well defined for triangular grids
# we can use either 
#  - triangle edge length or
#  - triangle surface area or
#  - the edge length of a equivalent square (with the same surface as the triangle)
#
# The real author of this code is Tobias KÃ¶lling. Thank you Tobi.
