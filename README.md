# mediocre_script_collection
Dubious collection of scripts for plotting ICON data. Most function are hand tailored (not in a good way) to specific data and problems.

If you write new code, it would be nice if it has [Doxygen type Docstrings](https://www.woolseyworkshop.com/2020/06/25/documenting-python-programs-with-doxygen/).

Or maybe, rather (Sphynx)[https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html)?
